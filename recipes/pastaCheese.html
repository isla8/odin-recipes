    <p>Pasta and Cheese has always been my favourite food ever since I was young. This is my own recipe (if you can even call it that hehe).</p>   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>As much pasta as you wish</li>
            <li>Freshly grated cheese</li>
            <li>(Optional) You may add sauces or herbs, anything that you think will make it taste better!</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil enough water so that all the pasta will be submerged</li>
            <li>When boiling, put in as much pasta as you desire</li>
            <li>Stir every few minutes to stop the pasta from sticking</li>
            <li>After about 8-10 minutes, check on how cooked the pasta is. If it is to your liking then take it off the heat and strain it</li>
            <li>Put the pasta on a plate or in a bowl</li>
            <li>Now grate cheese over the top (As much as you wish!)</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
